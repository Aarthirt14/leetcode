## Contains Duplicate – Learning Notes

Initial thought:
- Compare each element with all others (O(n²)) → inefficient

Improvement:
- Use a set to track previously seen values
- Reduce time complexity to O(n)

Key takeaway:
- When the problem asks about "already seen" elements,
  hashing is usually the right pattern.
